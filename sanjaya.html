    <div class="oneQuestion">
      <h2 class= "basic"> You want to know me more?</h2>
      <p> <strong>I am pet lover though I do not own any pet here in the US. I do have a cat back in my home country. I am not that kind of foodie person as I enjoy eating any kind of food. The last movie I watched is 'Houseful 3', an Indian movie when I was travelling back to my home country in aeroplane. I am planning to watch the new shows in the netflix. The last podcast I watched is the podcast of Joe Rogan with Elon Musk. My favorite subjects during my high school was Physics. To be honest, I listen to the random songs and even though I do not remember the lyrics I can jam within. </strong>

    <div class="secondQuestion">
      <h2 class= "basic"> Goals of my life</h2>
      <p><strong>
        I have a simple motto of my life: to enjoy throughout the journey. After graduating from the university with a degree of Computer Science, I want to work for any industry without stressing out. Whatever will be the journey, I should adapt and have fun. If I could go anywhere for a month, I would go to alaska for a greater adventure experiences. I do love travelling that involves a lot of adventures. The reason to choose dog if I have to live as an animal is their loyalty and affection towards anyone.
