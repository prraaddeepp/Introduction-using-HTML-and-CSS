  I was born on November 12, 2000. I am an international student from Nepal. I am a sophomore at Howard University. I am a Computer Science major. I love playing Chess and reading Novels. The Kite Runner is my favourite novel. In my free time, I love watching Tv series as well. Fun fact about me: Breaking Bad is my favourite show and I have watched it more than 10 times.<br>In my family, there are four members. My father is a police officer and my mother is a makeup artist. I have a brother who is studying Masters in Agriculture in Rampur University in Chitwan,Nepal.<br>
 I want to become a software engineer in the future. From the tech exchange, I hope that I will be learning different data structures and Algorithms. Along with that, I want to prepare for the interviews for internships as well. I hope to become a software engineer in the future.
